        <h2><i>Founded by Chef Govinda Rajan - or as he prefers, Govind or Mr Biryani -, we’ve come a long way since our beginnings in late 2017. As a self-professed biryani lover with fond memories of preparing the dish with his family during childhood, the journey began when one of our co-founders who’s too shy to be named introduced Govind to spices from India, urging him to experiment a Hyderabadi style. Curious to see just what difference it’ll bring, Govind took up the suggestion and was immediately enveloped by the aromas and flavours that are remarkably different from the countless biryani he has tried over the years - and by that, we really mean countless.

            Spurred by the discovery, Govind then went on to study different recipes in his pursuit for authenticity. From experimenting different recipes, watching YouTube tutorials, seeking cooking advice from friends within the Hyderabad community - all to achieve that one perfect base recipe. After months of trials and taste tests with friends, family and Hyderabad networks, the first recipe was ready for public debut.
            
            In our earlier days, we were once a hawker stall along the Commonwealth neighbourhood. As the word got out and demand grew, Govind soon realised that a bigger space was needed because the Hyderabadi style of biryani is equipment intensive with loads of careful preparations. Knowing that he wanted to be accessible to the Indian community, the first official Mr Biryani restaurant was then launched at 32 Norris Road in late 2018.
            
            Fast-forward to July 2021, we’ve hit the milestone of a new flagship along 11 Chander Road. Significantly upsized from our previous stores, we now have more room with seats across two storeys to welcome all biryani lovers and Indian food cravings. Whether it’s for two, friends, family or a celebration, we’re always ready to feed you with everything you love from us, with plenty of spice for a sweat-inducing satisfaction - after all, life is better when we dine together, and there’s always room for biryani.</i></h2><hr>
